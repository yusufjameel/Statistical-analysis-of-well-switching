Jameel, Y; R Mozummder, A van Geen and C Harvey, 2021, GeoHealth (in review). A statistical analysis of the pros and cons of field kits to guide well-switching in arsenic prone regions. Preprint available at https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10507167.1

Theere are two codes in this repository.

1)Fitting statistical distribution to paired arsenic data.R - In this code statistical distributions are fit to the paired measurements of field and laboratory measurements of arsenic in drinking water.

2)Switching_scenario_evaluation.R - In this code the statistical distributions obtained by fitting pdfs to the paried measurements are used to evaluate the effectiveness of different well switching scenarios based upon the laboratory measurements and simulated kit categories.
